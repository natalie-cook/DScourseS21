\section{Intrests}

Goals: I'd like to get as comfortable as possible using all of the tools and software that we're planning to encounter in this class. I am so excited to be in the class and get to learn practical skills that I can talk to recruiters/employers about after doing 4.5 years of theory and pretending I know how to apply it. I'm hoping that by the end of the semester I can feel like I actually know what I'm doing, and that I can feel proud about the quality/complexity of the project I complete. 

After Graduation:  I'm considering a masters program that would put me into the security/diplomacy/development world on an international scale depending on the concentration I pick. I am also looking at jobs - a big company with a strong training program would be nice. Finally, I might move back to Madrid and teach English for a while.

Project Ideas: I'd love to do something with COVID data/about its impact in some way. I know that really doesn't narrow it down. 

Interests: I feel like data science is an increasingly important skill set to have, and I'm hoping that I can find ways to really enjoy it. I'm working on being okay with feeling incompetent or having no idea what I'm doing as part of the learning process. The jargon is intense.
